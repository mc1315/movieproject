                    <h5>Indepdent, Loyal, & Determined</h5>
                    <p>Elizabeth Bennet, also known as Lizzy, is the heroine of the novel. The story is told mainly from her perspective and, despite the fact that she can be stubborn and strong-willed, the reader is encouraged to sympathise with her and hope for her happiness. Elizabeth has a lively and independent streak. She is quick-witted and playful, with a good sense of humour. Elizabeth takes pride in herself and her identity, and is very clear about what she wants from life: she wants to marry for love. One of Elizabeth’s strongest traits is her determination. She is determined to speak her mind and breaks the social rules imposed on women by Georgian society when she has to. Although she often teases her sisters, she is always the first to offer support and is fiercely loyal to her family.</p>

                    <h5>Proud, Principled, & Honest</h5>
                    <p>Mr Darcy is a rich, young gentleman who eventually becomes the romantic hero of the novel. Darcy is initially presented as a very proud man. He is proud of his status and appears to care a lot about social class. Darcy is also principled: he has clear views and morals, like Elizabeth does. Darcy is an honest man. As Austen tells the story from Elizabeth’s perspective, this honesty is sometimes viewed negatively. As the novel progresses, Darcy’s honesty becomes one of his most appealing qualities. He overcomes his social prejudice to show politeness and genuine interest in the Gardiners. At the end of the novel, Darcy is sincere and open about his true feelings for Elizabeth. He can articulate what he loves about her, and his honest behaviour throughout the novel means that the reader accepts his words as heartfelt and genuine.</p>

                    <h5>Patient & Generous</h5>
                    <p>At 22 years old, Jane is the eldest of the Bennet sisters. She is important in the novel because Mrs Bennet is keen for Jane to get married to secure her family’s future. Jane and Elizabeth’s relationship enables Austen to make contrasts between their attitudes and behaviours. An introvert, Jane is happy to listen to those around her before making a judgement or rushing to action. She is sensible, shy and has to make a great effort to socialise as she finds it difficult. Jane wants to see the good in others. She falls in love with Bingley for his ‘sensible, good-humoured and lively' manners. When in London, Jane waits in vain for Bingley to visit, not knowing that he is unaware that she is in the city. Later on, Jane shows friendship and kindness to her new sister-in-law Caroline, despite Caroline’s previous rudeness towards her.</p>

                    <h5>Optimistic & Open-minded</h5>
                    <p>Bingley is the “single man in possession of a good fortune” who is described in the opening line of the novel. At first, Bingley seems to be the hero of the novel. His good nature makes him an easy character for the reader to support, though Austen presents him as less interesting than the mysterious Darcy. Bingley is presented as a suitable match for Jane because of the similarities between them. Their marriage is ultimately presented as solid yet unexciting.</p>

                    <p>Charlotte Lucas is Elizabeth’s close friend. Even though she and Elizabeth are similar in their intelligence and sensible attitude, Charlotte is more pragmatic. She sees marriage as an economic transaction, describing marital happiness as “a matter of chance”. This means that her acceptance of Collins’ proposal is understandable to the reader, even though it is not to Elizabeth. Charlotte is careful in her judgements and actions, thinking more calmly than many of the other characters.</p>
