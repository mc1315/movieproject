                    <h4>Pride & Prejudice (2005)</h4>
                    <p>Sparks fly when spirited Elizabeth Bennet meets single, rich, and proud Mr. Darcy. But Mr. Darcy reluctantly finds himself falling in love with a woman beneath his class. Can each overcome their own pride and prejudice?</p>
                    <p>For many younger generations, this is the Pride And Prejudice movie that got them into Austen. And for good reason — the cinematography and soundtrack of the movie are stunning and the casting is superb. For many people, Keira Knightley is the definitive Elizabeth Bennet and Donald Sutherland makes for the perfect father to several young women growing up and falling in love. The movie was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Actress for Knightley. It was also nominated for six BAFTAs, winning Most Promising Newcomer for director Joe Wright.</p>

                    <h4>Pride & Prejudice (1940)</h4>
                    <p>Pride And Prejudice saw its first movie incarnation back in 1940. There have been so many Pride And Prejudice films since, but this was the first time it appeared for mainstream movie audiences. Far from being accurate where history is concerned, this movie is a fun and light-hearted adaptation of the beloved novel that paved the way for all the others that followed. The movie uses costuming later than the time period in which it is set and features a few changes, like an archery scene that never appeared in the novel. Ultimately, however, it's an incredibly successful early adaptation.</p>

                    <h4>Pride & Prejudice (1967)</h4>
                    <p>Released in 1967 on BBC, Pride & Prejudice came out as a miniseries on the 150th anniversary of Jane Austen's death. Celia Bannerman and Lewis Fiander starred as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in this version, which includes six episodes. Each episode is only 25 minutes though, so it's still a relatively quick watch for a serial adaptation. This is also an interesting release because it remains available to see online, but was never made available on home video, so Austen fans couldn't own a physical copy of the show.</p>

                    <h4>Pride & Prejudice (1980)</h4>
                    <p>In 1980, the BBC brought back Pride & Prejudice again, this time as another miniseries. It starred Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet and David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy. This version also aired in the United States thanks to the BBC's partnership with PBS television and Masterpiece Theatre.</p>

                    <h4>Pride & Prejudice (1995)</h4>
                    <p>For the generation who became familiar with the story before Knightley took on the role of Elizabeth, this adaptation is the definitive version of Austen's story. BBC's Pride And Prejudice does in a miniseries what the 2005 version couldn't do in a movie - it remains almost completely faithful to the source material. This was the project in which Colin Firth cemented himself as the ultimate Mr. Darcy. It's perfect for Jane Austen purists and casual fans alike, and to this day the Pride And Prejudice 1995 adaptation remains at the top of the best Pride & Prejudice movies for most fans.</p>

                    <h4>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</h4>
                    <p>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</p>
                    <p>Pride and Prejudice was written by Jane Austen in the years following 1796 before its original publication in 1813. It is Austen's second published novel, the first being Sense and Sensibility. Pride and Prejudice is written in a style of free, indirect speech like most of Jane Austen's works and has been the subject of many different film and television adaptations over the years. Written primarily from the perspective of the female protagonist, Miss Elizabeth Bennet, the reader follows her life and the lives of her sisters and the ever constant pursuit of marriage by nearly all of the female characters, excluding herself. Even in the modern day, Pride and Prejudice is seen as an important book by many literary experts.</p>

                    <h4>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</h4>
                    <p>Unlike many other Pride & Prejudice movies, it's interesting to note that Pride And Prejudice And Zombies is an adaptation of an adaptation. The book that inspired this 2016 movie took Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship and turned it upside down by including zombies. Yes, zombies in the 19th century. It's one of the most unique takes on Austen ever done. More parody than true adaptation, the movie certainly turned heads. It turns training in social niceties to training with specialized weapons and the attraction between Elizabeth and Darcy is sparked by a battle against zombies at a country dance.</p>

                    <h4>Bridget Jones's Diary</h4>
                    <p>It's funny how many people missed that Bridget Jones' Diary is meant to be a very loose adaptation of Jane Austen's original work. The best part is that the team behind the movie got the ultimate Mr. Darcy, Colin Firth, to play Darcy again. The movie follows Renee Zellwegger as the titular Bridget as she keeps a diary of the things she wishes would happen in her life. Her life, however, changes when two men she meets begin to vie for her affection a la Darcy and Wickham both going after Elizabeth Bennet.</p>
